NextJS Typescript application developed for my thesis. Uses a relatively simple 2-Opt algorithm implementation to calculate an optimised route for a given customer's shopping list, with the shopping list items all having a coordinate location associated with it. Provides the user with directions towards each item on the route, before returning them to the exit, forming a Hamiltonian cycle, using Manhattan distance calculations. Solutions provided are not always optimal, as 2-opt is approximate, but provided solutions are optimised and feasible for considerable N numbers.
